    "longdesc" : "LCALS (“Livermore Compiler Analysis Loop Suite”) is a collection of loop kernels based, in part, on historical “Livermore Loops” benchmarks (See the 1986 technical report: “The Livermore Fortran Kernels: A Computer Test of the Numerical Performance Range”, by Frank H. McMahon, UCRL-53745.). The suite contains facilities to generate timing statistics and reports.  The original suite was implemented in Fortran and translated to C by Steve Langer at LLNL in the mid-90s. The kernel loop bodies in LCALS are essentially C code, but the suite infrastructure is written in standard C++. Also, some loop traversal constructs require standard C++ 11."
