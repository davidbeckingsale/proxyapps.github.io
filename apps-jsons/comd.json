    "longdesc" : "CoMD is a reference implementation of classical molecular dynamics algorithms and workloads as used in materials science. It is created and maintained by The Exascale Co-Design Center for Materials in Extreme Environments (ExMatEx). The code is intended to serve as a vehicle for co-design by allowing others to extend and/or reimplement it as needed to test performance of new architectures, programming models, etc. New versions of CoMD will be released to incorporate the lessons learned from the co-design process."
