    "science" : "Compressible flow; Lagrangian frame",
    "shortdesc" : "Laghos solves the Euler equation of compressible gas dynamics in a Lagrangian frame using unstructured high-order finite elements."
    "longdesc" : "Laghos solves the time-dependent Euler equation of compressible gas dynamics in a moving Lagrangian frame using unstructured high-order finite element spatial discretization and explicit high-order time-stepping. It is built on top of a general discretization library (MFEM) and supports two modes: *full assembly*, where performance is limited by the data motion in a conjugate gradient (CG) solve, and *partial assembly*, where performance depends mostly on small dense matrix operations and the CG solve communication."
