    "longdesc" : "A simplified block-structured adaptive mesh refinement algorithm in two and three dimensions with subcycling in time. The algorithm solves a linear advection diffusion equation with a simple numerical method. This proxy app is intended to capture the communication pattern of an explicit AMR algorithm but does not represent an accurate characterization of floating point effort or relative costs of communication to computation."
