    "longdesc" : "HPGMG implements full multigrid (FMG) algorithms using finite-volume and finite-element methods. Different algorithmic variants adjust the arithmetic intensity and architectural properties that are tested. These FMG methods converge up to discretization error in one F-cycle, thus may be considered direct solvers. An F-cycle visits the finest level a total of two times, the first coarsening (8x smaller) 4 times, the second coarsening 6 times, etc."
