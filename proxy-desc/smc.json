    "longdesc" : "A minimalist high-order finite difference algorithm for combustion problems. It includes core discretizations for advection, diffusive transport and chemical kinetics. The models for computing diffusive transport coefficients have been replaced by a simplified approximation but the full structure of the discretization of the diffusive terms have been preserved."
