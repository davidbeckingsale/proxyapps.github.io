    "longdesc" : "At this time, miniXyce is a simple linear circuit simulator with a basic parser that performs transient analysis on any circuit with resistors (R), inductors (L), capacitors (C), and voltage/current sources. The parser incorporated into this version of miniXyce is a single pass parser, where the netlist is expected to be flat (no hierarchy via subcircuits is allowed). Simulating the system of DAEs generates a nonsymmetric linear problem, which is solved using un-preconditioned GMRES. The time integration method used in miniXyce is backward Euler with a constant time-step. The simulator outputs all the solution variables at each time step in a 'prn' file."
